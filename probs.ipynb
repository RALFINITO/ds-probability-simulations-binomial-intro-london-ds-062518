    "A binomial distribution can be thought of as simply the probability of a SUCCESS or FAILURE outcome in an experiment or survey that is repeated multiple times. The binomial is a type of distribution that has two possible outcomes (the prefix “bi” means two, or twice). For example, a coin toss has only two possible outcomes: heads or tails and taking a test could have two possible outcomes: pass or fail.\n",

    "For example, we could model flipping a fair coin 10 times with a binomial distribution where the number of trials is set to 10 and the probability of success is set to 0.5. In this case the distribution would tell us how likely it is to get zero heads, 1 head, 2 heads and so on.\n",
